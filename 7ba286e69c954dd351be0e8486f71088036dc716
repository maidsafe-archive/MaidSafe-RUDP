The following pull request increases RUDP connection bootstrap reliability by an enormous factor. It however also does at least these:

1. Opens connection hijacking such that an attacker can send an arbitrary new encryption key and take over the connection.

2. Enables DDoS through a packet replay attack.

3. Enables a rare (4%) packet avalanche and connection hang. It *usually* times out, but occasionally doesn't.

In short this code should not go anywhere near production code. Only use for testnet testing!
